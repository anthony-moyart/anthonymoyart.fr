# My personal website: [anthonymoyart.fr](https://www.anthonymoyart.fr)

This website is intended to provide information about me to people interested in hiring me as a free-lance developer,
and it is also intended to be a fun side-project.

Everything in it is mine: the (poor) design, the code, etc.  
I am a back-end developer, so I am not expert at any of these.

I decided to make it open-source for fun, but don't take any part of this code as a best-practice example, front-end
development is not my expertise, and this is the first time I work on a Next.js app.

You are free to fork it as you wish for your personal needs, but don't take it as a best-practices guide or anything.
You can probably find better inspirations somewhere else, again this is more of a fun project.

The design is mine, and I am definitely not a UI designer.
